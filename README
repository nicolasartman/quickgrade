Quick Grade
===========
*A rapid lab grading tool*


Overview
========

Quick Grade aims to make grading short lab-style assignments faster and with less chance of bias. The main techniques used to accomplish this are a mix of established tactics for ensuring fairness and new strategies for accelerating the grading workflow. It is designed to read in a google-forms formatted csv file, though more formats for assignment submission will be supported in the future.

Key Features (most of these are 'coming-soon')
============

Speed
-----
- No the need for physical organization and distribution of submissions. Takes up 0 desk space and no room in your office!
- Instant export to csv for integrating into your existing digital gradebook (future: configurable export format)
- Instantly view metrics on assignments and the course overall
- Highlight key words or phrases in your choice of colors, to quickly pinpoint problem (and success) areas.

Fairness
--------
- Automatically randomizes grading order for each question.
- "Horizontal" grading, a common but time consuming practice among many professors. Horizontal grading methods grade question-by-question, rather than student-by-student, to prevent a poor quality answer to one question from subconsciously biasing the grader on the next answer. Horizontal grading also helps the grader keep a single question in mind at a time, further preventing undesired grade variance.
  - Enhanced horizontal grading through multiple "rounds" of randomly ordered answers each question; averages are then calculated to ensure fluke scores are easily avoided.

Also: no server communication â€” everything is on your local computer so you can easily keep confidential data stafe and stay FERPA compliant.
